# Health-Expenditures-Economic-And-Health-Outcomes
This project explores the relationship between public health expenditures, health outcomes, and economic performance using data from the WHO Global Health Observatory, IMF, and World Bank.

In this project, we expore the relationship between public health expenditures and health outcomes using a comprehensive dataset that included various parameters such as GDP per capita, life expectancy, unemployment rate, population growth, neonatal mortality rate, health expenditure as a percentage of GDP, and health expenditure per capita. Our goal is to understand how health investments impact the overall health and economic performance of countries worldwide.
